% Berkeley is a standard choice for presentation,
% PaloAlto is similar to Berkeley, but with round bullets,
% Copenhagen and Warsaw are good alternative, with navigation bars at the
% top and author, title at the bottom of each slide
% Darmstadt is similar, but doesn't have author/title at bottom
% Singapore is the least "flashy" of the themes, suitable for printing

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Hydra} are small, freshwater hydrozoans (family Cnidaria)
\item Believed to have originated around 60 Mya \cite{age}
\item Cnidarians first appeared around 580 Mya, haven't changed much since
\item Ideal for studying development of common features across animals

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Hydra} have diffuse nerve nets rather than a CNS
\item Once mature, a constant density gradient of neurons is maintained \cite{density}
